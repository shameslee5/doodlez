Finding a completely [black Bernedoodle](https://doodlaze.com/bernedoodle-black-and-white/) is pretty rare. This is because it needs a hidden gene from both parent dogs. Typically, what breeders classify as solid black is when they are mostly all black with some white on their feet or a little bit of tan. This is typically the lowest price point for a Bernedoodle.
